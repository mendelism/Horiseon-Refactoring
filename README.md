Code Refactoring

This is a static HTML website with CSS styling.
It is the end product of refactoring practice.

The primary goals are readability, accessibility, and long-term codebase sustainability:
>* Implementing semantic tags to improve structural readability
>* Improving CSS efficiency through code reorganization (e.g. consolidating CSS selectors and organizing them relative to HTML semantic structure)
>* Adding alt attributes to icon and image elements and a descriptive title to improve accessibility
>* Adding comments to support future codebase work
