# Code Refactoring

This is a static HTML website with CSS styling.
It is the end product of refactoring practice.

## Primary Goals

Readability, accessibility, and long-term codebase sustainability are achieved through:

>* Implementing semantic tags to improve structural readability
>* Improving CSS efficiency through code reorganization (e.g. consolidating CSS selectors and organizing them relative to HTML semantic structure)
>* Adding alt attributes to icon and image elements and a descriptive title to improve accessibility
>* Adding comments to support future work

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```
